This was setup with the intention of being deployed on a linux server.
You will need to add the required crontab to a user with the correct permissions to run everything.
You will need a program to host the static files in /gui/. I recommend nginx as the setup is fairly straight forward.
Once those are hosted, you will need a  WSGI server to run the flask API. I recommend gunicorn for ease of setup but other options work as well.For the sake of safety and stability, I recommend creating a virtual enviornment that we can run our API/WSGI in.
Once the WSGI server is online, you will need to setup an internal proxy to route the localhost port the WSGI server is hosted on to /api/ as that is where the js files are pointed. 
    That step is slightly unnecessary, but skipping it would require changing all the JS to point to 127.0.0.1:xxxx

Once all that is done. You should be good to go. Although, I recommend setting your WSGI/virtual enviornment startup and web hosting of the static files as services and enabling them so that things come back online automatically when the server gets rebooted.
