    <h1>How to Use the Backup Viewer</h1>
    <p>This page is designed for comparisons and pulling any necessary data. Follow the steps below to use the Backup Viewer effectively:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>First, select the switch you want to examine and the type of data you want to analyze. These options are located at the top center of the page.</li>
        <li>Next, choose the date and time for the old data you want to view.</li>
        <li>For the new data, either select a date and time or check the checkbox to pull live data from the switch. Note that live data retrieval takes longer as it directly interacts with the switch.</li>
        <li>If you select "last" in the time options for either backup data, the system will use the latest backup from the chosen date.</li>
        <li>Click the <strong>Go</strong> button to retrieve the relevant data for both sides.</li>
        <li>Press the <strong>Compare</strong> button below to generate a changelog of the differences between the two selected data points.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Use the Track IP Page</h2>
    <p>The Track IP page allows you to find where an IP was routed on a specific day. Hereâ€™s how to use it:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Enter a date and the IP address you want to track.</li>
        <li>The server will attempt to locate the routing information for that date. This page automatically uses the latest configurations from the chosen date.</li>
        <li>Note: This feature does not search ARP tables; it only analyzes configuration files.</li>
    </ul>
